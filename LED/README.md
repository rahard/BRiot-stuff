Files for LED-related codes/examples.

These files (examples) should work for Arduino boards and
ESPectro board (and perhaps other ESP-based boards).
The only thing that we have to consider is the pin arrangement.

Due to PlatformIO's configuration, current code is in "src" directory.
It's just for compiling. 

* alternate.ino: 101010, then 010101, then 101010, ... etc
* enterexit.ino: lights entering ... then exiting ...
* knightrider.ino: lights going left to right to left ...
* ledmeter.ino: using LED as a meter (sort of), graphic equalizer?
* rotate.ino: rotate (left/right) the content of LED 
* turnoff.ino: just to turn off LEDs
