# Espectro Board Stuff

This directory is for DycodeX's Espectro board stuff. 
Some of the codes are the same as other boards, eg. blinking LED.
Thus, they are located in the ../LED directory.

Base/      => Espectro Base board (not the core board) stuff
Neopixel/  => Neopixel related stuff. This is the same as Adafruit Neopixel
